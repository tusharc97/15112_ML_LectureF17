The code examples presented in the lecture can be found in the "Decision Trees" and "MNIST" folders. To use this code, you must install the scikit-learn module, which you can get using conda or pip.

Samples using the Keras module can be found under the "Keras Samples" folder. The two examples given are MNIST (handwritten digit recognition) and Housing Prices.

Remember that if you want to use the code examples from here, you must cite them appropriately!
